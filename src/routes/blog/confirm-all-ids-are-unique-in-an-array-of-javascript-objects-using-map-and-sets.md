excerpt: Working with arrays of objects in JavaScript can be difficult. This post covers how to ensure all object keys (IDs) are unique, and how to find non-unique values.

Recently, working on my [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) side project ([smitty.netlify.com](https://smitty.netlify.com)), I came across the need to verify that all object properties in an array of objects were unique.

That's a little tough to explain in writing, so here's an example:

```javascript
const items = [
  { 
    name: 'The first object', 
    id: 1 
  }, {
    name: 'Another object',
    id: 42
  }, {
    name: 'Here is a third object',
    id: 100
  }, {
    name: 'Oops! This one is a duplicate',
    id: 42
  },
  // ...etc.
]
```

In my case, the IDs were hard-coded (rather than generated programmatically). As such, they were subject to human error, and I discovered that some IDs were duplicated.

This was an issue because the ID numbers were being used for setting the HTML `id`s in a form; that meant some of the `<label>` elements were being associated with the wrong input, which is pretty disastrous in a production app!


## The solution:

**How to find the duplicates though?** In my case there were 100 unique objects in the array, so while combing through them manually certainly wasn't impossible, it was going to be a tedious task. The solution was to use JavaScript's `map` method and `Set` functionality.

- **`map`** takes an array, and _maps_ each thing in that array to a new array. (Here, we use it to create a new array with _just_ the original IDs.)
- **`Set`**s in JavaScript create new arrays (technically, sets) with only _unique_ values. (For example, the `Set` of `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2]` is `[0, 1, 2]`

To extract only the IDs of the original array, the code looks like this (where the original array is named `items`):

```javascript
const IDs = new Set(items.map(item => item.id))
```

Now we've got an array of only unique IDs. What next?

Well, if we _did_ have duplicate IDs in our original `items` array, then the length of `IDs` will be _different_ than the length of the original array. So it's a quick conditional check, which would _seem_ like this, but beware! We're missing a step:

```javascript
IDs.length === items.length
// Always returns false ðŸ¤”
```

**Heads up!** That won't _quite_ work, because `Set`s and arrays in JavaScript are _**not**_ the same thing! The above comparison will always return `false` because, if you check, `IDs.length` is `undefined`. (That's because `.length` is a method on arrays, not sets.)

To fix the issue, we can just add a bit of ES6 destructuring to convert the set into an array:

```javascript
[...IDs].length === items.length
// Now it works!
// true if all IDs were unique, false if not
```

If you prefer, this is a little more explicit and works the same way; I just prefer the above shorthand, personally:

```javascript
// Another way to do the same thing:
Array.from(IDs).length === items.length
```


## Make it reusable

If this is an issue you might run into frequently, you can abstract it to a function like so:

```javascript
// Reusable function to check uniqueness of keys in an array of objects 
const isEverythingUnique = (arr, key) => {   
    const uniques = new Set(arr.map(item => item[key]);   
    return [...uniques].length === arr.length; 
}
```

And call it with, e.g., `isEverythingUnique(items, 'id');` (which would return `false` in our case, because there are two objects each with `id: 42`).

If the function returns `true`, then you know all the keys are unique. Otherwise, you have non-unique keys (IDs).

To find out _which_ ones are duplicates, you can use this handy function which I developed from [this Hacker Noon post](https://hackernoon.com/finding-non-unique-elements-in-javascript-d934e6fd6260):

```javascript
// Reusable function to show the duplicate keys in an array of objects
const getDuplicates = (arr, key) => {
  const keys = arr.map(item => item[key]);
  return keys.filter(key => keys.indexOf(key) !== keys.lastIndexOf(key)) 
}
```

Call this function just like the one above, e.g., `getDuplicates(items, 'id')`, which in our case, would get you an array that contains the non-unique IDs, like this:

```javascript
getDuplicates(items, 'id')
 
// [42, 42]
```
