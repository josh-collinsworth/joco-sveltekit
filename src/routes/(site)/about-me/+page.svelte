		<h2>Who I am</h2>

		<p>
			I'm currently a Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a>
			(<i
				>I made
				<a href="https://deno.com/brand">the new logo</a>, so I guess I'm
				technically still a designer, too</i
			>). I've been with Deno since 2023, and before that, I spent a couple of
			years as a senior frontend developer at
			<a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my spare time, I enjoy hobby coding; I'm the maker and designer of the
			word games <i>Quina</i>
			(<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quina/id1636895462">iOS</a>/<a
				href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.quina.collinsworth"
				>Android</a
			>/<a href="https://quina.app">web</a>) and <i>Hondo</i>
			(<a
				href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hondo/id1636016699?platform=iphone"
				>iOS</a
			>/<a
				href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playhondo.www.twa"
				>Android</a
			>/<a href="https://playhondo.com">web</a>). I wrote and maintain an
			open-source SvelteKit static blog starter (when I have the time, at leastâ€”<a
				href="https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter"
				>repo</a
			>/<a href="https://sveltekit-static-starter.netlify.app">demo</a>), and I
			still do occasional freelance development and design.
		</p>

		<p>
			Previously, I worked as a Senior JavaScript developer at <a
				href="https://aware3.com">Aware3</a
			>, and as a front-end engineer at
			<a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a>. Before becoming a full-time
			dev, I was a senior support lead at
			<a href="https://getflywheel.com">Flywheel</a>, and also a course
			instructor for
			<a href="https://interfaceschool.com">AIM Code School</a>, where I taught
			WordPress development, and was solely responsible for both curriculum
			development and teaching.
		</p>

		<p>
			As a writer, I authored the CSS Tricks series <a
				href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-npm/"
				>A Complete Beginner's Guide to NPM</a
			>, and I enjoy blogging about dev, design and tech (both
			<a href="#writing">freelance</a>
			and
			<a href="blog">here on this site</a>). Occasionally, I get asked to talk
			about what I write
			<a href="#appearances">on podcasts</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before entering tech, I spent a few years as a graphic designer (that's
			what my degree is in), worked in foodservice, and was a regularly gigging
			musician (though not otherwise successful).
		</p>

		<p>
			I lived in Omaha for most of my career, but I've been in Kansas City since
			2022.
		</p>

		<p>
			Personally, I am a: hobby coder; font hoarder; husband since 2012; dad
			since 2019 (though notorious for dad jokes since long before);
			accessibility advocate; DEI accomplice; cold brew aficionado; Facebook,
			Instagram, and Twitter abandoner; Mastodon appreciator; semi-notorious
			React critic; occasional public speaker and podcast guest; pun enthusiast;
			curious learner; dog person; lifelong Nintendo fan;
			musician/guitarist/hack pianist; he/him/his; liberal abuser of semicolons.
