I love the term "pyrrhic victory." It's such a wonderful phrase to describe a triumph that comes at too great a cost to even be worthwhile.

For example: imagine a sports team ekes out a gutsy win, but at the cost of injuring all its starters. The team won in the short term, but put itself in such a terrible position that it might have been better in the long term just to forfeit and keep its players healthy.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

That's the definition of pyrrhic victory; a win that's as bad as, or worse than, a&nbsp;loss.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

"Pyrrhic" seems to come from the same root word as "fire." It conjures the image of someone willing to burn everything to the ground to achieve their desired outcome.

It's on my mind because lots of companies seem to be seeking their own fiery victories these days, whether through cannibalizing its own users, or destroying the goodwill it has with its own employees.

Let's start with Netflix, who is currently attempting to win a battle against password-sharing users ("pirates," as the company likes to call them). And I believe that victory—like most similar battles corporations choose to fight in order to claw value back—will likely come at a cost greater than simply taking that "L" and moving on to the next game.

## The so-called piracy problem

To set the stage here: Netflix has a long and storied history of fighting against "piraters" (meaning: people who share their Netflix password with others).

I have to assume at some point, Netflix ran the data and figured out a reasonable estimate of how many of their accounts were being shared. (Presumably, it's not hard for Netflix to do something like check how many IP addresses any given account is being accessed from.) Then, Netflix assigned a dollar amount to that figure; "this is how much money we're losing because of piracy." And whatever that number was, I'm sure it was a _big_ one.

Netflix execs and board members (presumably) looked at that Super Big Number and thought, "_we have to do something about this_." That Super Big Number, it must have appeared, was money being effectively _stolen_ from Netflix.

Now, I don't know how Netflix came up with their Super Big Number, or what it was, exactly. I've got to believe a company as big and successful as Netflix (the literal N in FAANG, even if that acronym isn't very accurate anymore) employs plenty of incredibly smart people who know a lot more about this kind of stuff than I do.

But I also have a decent idea of how execs think, and I know if you put a big number in front of them and give them the notion that they're missing out on it, their loss aversion reflex is gonna kick in and they'll go charging like a mad bull.

<SideNote>

In case you're not familiar with the psychological term: "loss aversion" is an aspect of human psychology that makes us feel loss (real or perceived) much more acutely than we feel a similar gain.

Losing $100 will bring your happiness down by much more than a sudden gain of $100 will bring it up. That means we're much more likely to focus on things we've lost (or feel we've lost, or might lose) than things we can attain, even when the gains outweigh the loss.

</SideNote>

Seems to me there are a few problems with thinking the piracy problem a) is the main issue; and b) can actually be fixed like Netflix seems to think it can.

To be sure, people exploiting the system by sharing a single account login with dozens or even hundreds of others is a problem. I don't think most people would disagree with that, or say that Netflix is wrong in doing so.

But there's a wide and varied spectrum of people who might share their account--and lumping them all together is, I feel, part of the mistake.

Cory Doctorow covers this excellently in the post, [Netflix wants to chop down your family tree](https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/02/nonbinary-families/). He goes into much greater detail than I will here about the fraught proposition that anyone--let alone the homogenous people in Silicon Valley boardrooms--can neatly define a "household" in a way that includes everyone and doesn't leave out, say, families who don't happen to live together (extremely common).

I encourage you to read the article; there are many angles I don't have the time to touch on here that deserve the spotlight on their own. (The bit about how Netflix itself was once widely accused of pirating content in its DVD-mailing days, in a way that closely mirrors how the company now accuses users of pirating its own content, is not to be missed.)

I'm certain I'm not the only Netflix subscriber who gladly shelled out the top-tier premium price for their Netflix subscription, in order to share it with a very small number of immediate family members, each of whom has their own profile within the app. (Netflix limits the number of available profiles per account purposefully, to discourage sharing too widely. I've been happy to stay within this limitation, as I assume many users are.)

Sweeping up legitimate family sharing situations along with the kinda-sorta-criminal password sharers is a move that strikes me as counterproductive, if not wholly ill-advised.

Capitalistic mindset would say that as long as there's a product that people value, they'll pay for it. But humans just aren't that simple (or rational, for that matter).

A person's relationship with any business or brand is just that; a relationship. People are happy when they feel the relationship is good, and unhappy when they feel it's bad, and when they get unhappy enough, they end the relationship.

Last night, I turned on my streaming device, and instead of the familiar loading screen, I was stopped dead in my tracks by an ominous, imposing blockade of a message.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

I was finally prompted, as I knew I eventually would be, to press the button that locks every family member who doesn't live within range of my wi-fi network out of my Netflix account.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

As mentioned, I've been sharing this account with immediate family members for years. Just three of them, each of whom has their own profile. Nobody aside from them has my password or uses my account. I paid for the highest-tier plan available, so that if we all happened to want to watch something at the same time, we could.

I did everything I could do to keep this arrangement above-board, as far as Netflix is concerned. We even booted my wife's brother from the plan when he graduated college and her parents retired, to give them his profile slot instead. And for _years_, Netflix was fine with this--or at the very least, was content to look the other way and generally see people wanting to watch their shows as a _good_ thing.

How do you think I feel about this relationship now?

<CalloutPlusQuote>

I would guess I'm far from the only user who is, right now, closer to cancelling Netflix than they have ever been before.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

That's another problem with going after that Super Big Number; there's _another_, hidden Super Big Number, which is the _cost_ of going after the first one.

The hidden cost includes things like users who decide to downgrade their account now that they can't share it, or who cancel outright. It includes people whose trust in the brand is damaged enough that they don't sign up when they would've otherwise. It includes the value drop that comes from bad publicity. It includes the cost of losing employees who were forced to help build this thing and didn't want to, or who aren't sure they really want to be a part of this anymore. It includes the cost of people at your company not being quite as proud, not recruiting quite as well, not feeling quite as productive.

Netflix has put plenty of ways in place for users to either spin off their profile into a new account, or to add extra people to an account for a slightly discounted price. (To add my family members to my account tne _new_ way would've pretty much doubled what I pay, so I'm not doing that.)

It will be interesting to see whether those options actually add up to a gain on the bottom line. My guess would be that when the dust settles, it's all going to be pretty much a wash; the people who downgrade or cancel as a result of the crackdown will be offset more or less evenly by the people who say ok and pay extra for the privilege of watching shows on two or more IP addresses.

If I'm right--or even close to right--Netflix comes out of this whole fiasco in basically the same financial shape as before, with a worse image, and customers who are less happy.

Pyrrhic victory attained.

### Netflix and Metallica

This whole situation reminds me of Lars Ulrich vs. Napster in the early 2000s; Metallica sued Napster for millions because its songs were found on the platform (to oversimplify).

Legally, Metallica was right and Napster was wrong. But apart from the technical "W" on the legal scoreboard, it's debatable whether that fight was worth fighting for the band.

Presumably, the band saw their own Super Big Number of album sales that weren't happening, and wanted it back. But the logic was similarly flawed, for two reasons:

First, just because somebody downloaded a song for free doesn't mean they would've gone out and bought the album. So that math is wrong.

But more importantly, a number of studies actually suggested that P2P downloads _helped_ bands sell albums and get discovered.

Instead of being happy that people wanted to listen to their music--and, crucially, seeing the value in encouraging those listeners, knowing it would help foster new generations of fans who would buy albums and concert tickets and t-shirts, keeping the band thriving—Metallica chose to go to war. And they won that war, yes. But again, I have to ask: did they really come away with anything worthwhile?

The band degraded themselves in the public eye, Lars Ulrich's name became a punch line, Metallica's brand became that of the litigious (if not _entitled_) metal band. It's reasonable to wonder whether that balances out, at the end of the day.

Obviously, I'm speculating here. I don't have access to Metallica's album sales figures or the desire to go find them, let alone project an alternate version of history. I also don't think most people would say Napster was fine or that artists were wrong to be bothered that their music was being distributed for free. That's not my point.

My point is: it was very easy to _overestimate_ the "lost" value, and therefore, to _underestimate_ the cost of going to battle to retrieve it. That's what leads companies like Netflix to embark on massive campaigns against costs and lost profits; corporate-level loss aversion.

## First you want attention, then you want money

Netflix once considered eyeballs a _good_ thing. As a company, it knew, at least to some degree, that more people watching was better, and tied its definition of success to that metric (not unlike a band that knows the number of fans it has is an indirect but highly influential factor in its success).

But eventually, capitalism ruins everything, since anything that produces money when burned will be set ablaze sooner or later. And now Netflix doesn't care so much about the future; it cares about shareholder value _now_. Loss aversion is a hell of a drug even for an individual, but I'm sure when you see the numbers on a pie chart in a boardroom, it's downright intoxicating.

<PullQuote>

The price some people are willing to pay for the product is $0, and you won't change that by raising the rent.

</PullQuote>

Netflix is making the same miscalculation, however, that Metallica did, and that most companies do: it quantifies the unspent dollars, and thinks, "_all of those dollars can be ours if we just_ do _something about it_!"

But it should be clear that's a fantasy; a fixation on a problem that mostly can't be fixed. The price some people are willing to pay for the product is $0, and you won't change that by raising the rent. Most of the people who used Napster didn't go out and buy the CDs after the service shut down, and I would bet most of the people "pirating" Netflix aren't going to become loyal subscribers just because there's a crackdown.

I have been a Netflix subscriber, continuously, for over twelve years. Back-of-the-napkin math says I'm pretty close to giving Netflix more money than I paid for my last _car_. But now, I'm forced to choose between either cutting off my family entirely; or paying much more money, and taking on significantly more admin/management work, just to keep using the service the same way I always was.

I chose to downgrade, personally. I don't honestly think the rest of my family watches enough Netflix to justify doubling my subscription cost. I don't think any of them are likely to sign up on their own, either.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

So in my case, the end result of all of this is: Netflix tries to claw back money, and ends up losing it instead.

Most people who illegally downloaded _Enter Sandman_ aren't going to go out and buy the album.

## Piracy isn't the problem

We should at least acknowledge that "infinite growth" mindset is in part what's brought about this "problem" for Netflix. A tanker's worth of ink has been spilled on how Netflix's growth has plateaued in recent years, and how each successive quarter is no longer better than the one before it, as was the trend for years.

My response to that is: of _course_ the growth has plateaued. There's literally nothing else growth can do, could do, or will do. The line cannot continuously go up forever. There is a finite supply of humans who see any company's value proposition as worthwhile, and there are only two ways to approach that supposed problem:

1. Continue adding value to the product;
2. Cannibalize the users you have.

That's it. Those are the two choices. But for some reason, with darling tech companies like Netflix, people actually start to _believe_ there's a third option: the company will just never stop growing, and live out its eternal youth in some sort of corporate inversion of Never-Never Land.

But no, that can't be it. It must be the pirates who are the problem. Why, because of them, the company is suffering from eleventy billion dollars of lost revenue.

Ok.

Let's pretend for a moment that's _actually_ the problem. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Netflix actually _is_ on the path to continuous growth—or at least _would_ be, if it weren't for you meddling kids. (Thousands of meddling kids. Armies of them. All pirating episodes of Chico Bon-Bon all day long.)

And let's go ahead and further assume this crackdown is a success, and all that lost revenue comes back. The evil empire is defeated, and there are medals and a parade and everything.

Hell, let's assume all those people who _were_ pirating Netflix go ahead and sign up for accounts. No hard feelings. No loss of brand trust or loyalty.

At the end of all of that--when the dust settles and the earnings are in and everybody in the boardroom is happy at the next quarterly results call--Netflix still has the same problem. It can't grow further unless it does something to entice people who weren't using it before to start using it now. But those people are increasingly unlikely to pay, and increasingly the only people left. And Netflix hasn't done a single thing to make them more likely to sign up by cracking down.
