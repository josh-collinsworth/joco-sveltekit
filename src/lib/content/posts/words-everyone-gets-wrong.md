English is a weird language. It's essentially centuries-old bloatware, still running, consistently being updated, but largely made up of strange, ill-advised, or nonsensical patches and legacy commits (often copied and pasted straight from other languages).

One interesting result of this linguistic mishmash is that some rarely-used words survive purely because they exist in a common phrase or idiom. (Some linguists call this "fossilization;" the word is preserved inside a familiar wrapper.)

Take, for example the term: "wreak havoc." It's common enough that you've probably heard it fairly regularly, but I don't think I've ever heard the word "wreak" used in everyday language. I'm not even sure how else you'd use it, exactly, if it wasn't paired with "havoc." (“_Time to eat, everyone, dinner is wreaked!_” Nope, that doesn't sound right.)

But in any case, I'm sure it's not _reek_ havoc. (That, I suppose, would be some kind of chaotic smell?)

Ok, so you might not use that specific example a lot. Not a lot of occasion in your life to discuss havoc being wreaked, perhaps. But many similar, widely-used phrases and idioms contain old, misunderstood words. So, in the interest of helping you type these phrases correctly, let's get down to the list.


## Core tenet

A **tenet** is a principle or belief; “_one-way data flow is a core **tenet** of React_.” (By the way: be sure to keep _principle_ and _principal_ straight, but that's slightly off-topic.)

**Tenet** is commonly confused with the much more common word "tenant," which  is somebody who occupies rented space; “_we're considering leasing part of our office out to a tenant_.”

So the phrase is _core **tenet**_, not _core tenant_. (I guess unless you mean the party renting the innermost center space.)

## Unfazed

People commonly type "unphased" when they mean “**unfazed**." The latter is what you want.

**Fazed** describes a reaction of concern or disconcertion; “_although I was disturbed by my teammate's behavior, my manager seemed **unfazed**_.”

The more common word "phase" is a generally stage; something you go through, like a phase of the moon. “_We're currently in our hyper-growth phase_.” But don't get them confused; you mean someone is "unfazed," not "unphased."


## The utmost

**Utmost** means: the absolute highest possible. “_I have the **utmost** respect for everything our CEO has accomplished, but he's still wrong about our team's needs_.” Or: “_this meeting is of the **utmost** importance_.”

Many people mishear **utmost** as "upmost," which actually _is_ a word, but not the right one. Upmost means "uppermost" or "top." (When playing a card game, you typically draw the _upmost_ card from the deck.) So it's technically not _semantically wrong_ to use in place of **utmost**, but it's still not exactly right, either, because **utmost** is the word from the common phrase.


## Albeit

**Albeit** means the same thing as "although": “_they're a great client to have, **albeit** a demanding one_.” Or: “_we're making progress, **albeit** slowly._”

**Albeit** just happens to sound like "I'll be it, or "all be it," neither of which is correct in this context.


## Moot point

**Moot** means meaningless or irrelevant. “_I mentioned all the ways NextJS is a poor choice for us, but it was a moot point, as it's too late to change now._”

People commonly mistake **moot** for "mute," but that's wrong. It's a **moot** point, not a point that's silent or speechless.


## Rein / reign

**Reins** are used to control a mount or a chariot, and that's where many modern idioms come from, like **rein** (it) in: “_he kept losing the audience with bad jokes, so I told him to **rein** it in_.” Or: “_we need to figure out how to **rein** in our expenses._”

It's also the same word used in phrases like “taking the **reins**”, i.e., passing steering control to another person: “_our CEO announced she'll be handing the **reins** over to a new leader._”

**Rein** is commonly confused with _two_ homophones: reign, and rain. But reign is what a ruler or champion does, and rain, of course, might fall on a parade.


## Wary / weary / leery

These may be the most commonly confused words on this list.

To be **wary** is to be cautious or skeptical; “_our vendor is promising a 200% improvement in performance if we sign with them now, but I'm **wary**_.”

**Leery** means the same thing: “_I'm **leery** of any company that makes such bold claims_.”

**Weary**, however, means "tired." “_I'm **weary** from being up late last night_.” Weary is often mistakenly used instead of wary, though, probably because it sounds a lot like leery.


## Per se

This one is doubly tricky, because the original phrase is not only Latin, but it's _also_ commonly misused and misunderstood.

People commonly use **per se** to mean "exactly," as in: “_I wouldn't say I was mad about it, **per se**_.” But while that usage isn't always wrong, it isn't always right, either.

**Per se** _actually_ means "by itself," "on its own," or "intrinsically." You can substitute **per se** anywhere you might use the phrase "in and of itself":

“_I don't hate Tailwind **per se** (in and of itself), I just can't stand the culture around it_.” Or: “_it wasn't a bad decision **per se** (on its own), but it's having some undesirable side effects_.”


## Chock-full

One of the more archaic words on the list, a **chock**, in this case, is a wooden wedge stuffed into a barrel to fill any empty gaps. (You may also know a "chock" as a triangular block used to keep wheels from rolling, but that's a slightly different meaning.)

In this context, chocks were used to prevent the contents of containers from shifting in transit, and to make sure there was no empty space for anything unwanted to get into or hide in.

So to say something is stuffed to the maximum, you say it's **chock-full**: “_that presentation was **chock-full** of useful information to take back to the team_.” (Notice the hyphenation.)

Some people mishear the phrase as "chalk full," but that's not a phrase, and it's also “**chock-full**,” not “_chocked_-full." (You may, however, _chalk_ it up to a misunderstanding.)


## Flesh out / flush out

You **flesh out** a loose concept or idea; “_we had a meeting to **flesh out** the design of the new feature in more detail_.”

You **flush out** something you want to be removed, especially from a hiding place. “_We were finally able to **flush out** the code causing those flaky CI errors_.”


## Elicit / illicit

Probably not as common as most of the mistakes on this list, but still worth a mention, since these homophones are easily confused.

To **elicit** is to evoke or draw out a reaction: “_the CEO's sexist comments **elicited** some strong pushback_.”

**Illicit** means forbidden or illegal: “_we're not supposed to have games on our company laptops, but Todd installed an **illicit** copy of Balatro_.”

## Say your piece / say your peace

These two phrases are actually both correct, but you'd use them differently.

To say your **piece** is to state your opinion; to play your part (your **piece**). “_I **said my piece** in the meeting, as did everyone else_.”

To **say your peace**, on the other hand, is getting everything off your chest. You might **say your peace** at a funeral, for example, or in a deep conversation. “_We had a long conversation where I **said my peace** on everything I've been feeling, and now I'm ready to move on._” It means to be at peace, because you've said everything you have to say.


## Discrete / discreet

These words aren't as old-fashioned as many on the list, but I felt they were worth including since they're very easily confused. (I have to look it up every time myself.)

**Discrete** means separate or distinct: “_our email is sent from a **discrete** server not connected with our main app_.”

**Discreet** means unobtrusive, careful, or concealed: “_our manager wasn't supposed to say anything, but they **discreetly** warned us layoffs might be coming_.”

A mnemonic to help remember the two: the one that means _separate_ has the E's at the end _separated_ by a T.


## Ulterior motives

**Ulterior** refers to something intentionally hidden. “_Our competitor seems interested collaborating with us on this initiative, but I suspect they have **ulterior** motives_.”

**Ulterior** is commonly misspelled "alterior," because that sounds a bit like "alternate," and to say somebody has _alternate motives_ makes sense in this context. But that's not a word, and not the proper phrase.


## Sleight of hand

**Sleight** means cunning and dextrous. “_The app feels fast, but it's actually some behind-the-scenes **sleight of hand** that makes it feel more speedy than it actually is._”

"Slight of hand" is an understandable mishearing, but it's still incorrect, as "slight" doesn't mean the same thing as **sleight**.


## Eke (out)

Commonly confused with **eek** (which is what you might say if you're surprised or scared), **eke** is a separate word that means to get by, but just barely. “_Thanks to that last-second field goal, they were just able to **eke** out the win_.”
