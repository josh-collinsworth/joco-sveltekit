Look, I know there are already a million articles just like this out there. But I have my own group of pet mistakes that I commonly notice, particularly from people in tech. (Or, maybe from everyone, but I just think it's people in tech because that tends to be my core digital social group.)

Either way, here are some mistakes you can hopefully avoid after reading this post. (I plan on adding new entries as they come up.)

## The list of words and phrases


### Tenant / tenet

A **tenant** is somebody who occupies rented space; “_we're considering leasing part of our office out to a **tenant**_.”

A **tenet** is a principle or belief; “_one-way data flow is a core **tenet** of React_.”


### Phased / fazed

People commonly say "unphased" when they mean "unfazed." The latter is what you want.

A **phase** is a generally stage; something you go through, like a phase of the moon. “_We're currently in our hyper-growth **phase**_.”

**Fazed** describes a reaction of concern; “_although I worried about meeting our new goals, my manager seemed **unfazed**_.”


### Utmost / upmost

**Utmost** is a somewhat archaic word, so it's not surprising it causes confusion.

**Utmost** means: the absolute highest possible. “_I have the **utmost** respect for everything our CEO has accomplished, but he's still wrong about our team's needs_.” Or: “_this meeting is of the **utmost** importance_.”

**Upmost** isn't a commonly used word, but it means the top thing in a group; when playing a card game, you typically draw the **upmost** card from the deck. So it's technically not _semantically wrong_ to use in place of utmost, but it's still not exactly right, either, because utmost is the word from the common phrase.


### Albeit / I'll be it / all be it

**Albeit** means the same thing as "although": “_they're a great client to have, **albeit** a demanding one_.” It just happens to sound like "I'll be it" (or "all be it"), which aren't correct in this context.


### Loose / lose

Classic internet blunder here, but you **lose** your keys, or **lose** a game; **loose** is the opposite of tight.

_We might **lose** this client if we don't fix our **loose** quality control._


### A part of / apart of

People very frequently leave out the space in "a part," which turns it into the word "apart"—which is frequently the opposite of what you might mean by "a part."

“_I'm happy to be **a part of** the team_” is correct, but you're not happy to be _**apart of**_ the team (at least, not unless you're clumsily saying you're happy to be **apart** from them and not together with them).

Another way of putting it: to say _integrity is **a part of** our company's values_ is virtually the opposite of saying _integrity is **apart of** our company's values_.


### Say my piece / say my peace

These are actually both valid, but they mean slightly separate things.

To **say your piece** is to state your opinion; to say your part. “_In the meeting, I said my piece on our roadmap, and everyone else chimed in with their own takes, too_.”

To **say your peace** is to say everything you have to say, or finally get everything off your chest; “_I had a one-on-one with the CEO, and I said my peace on everything I've been feeling about the company's new direction, so now I'm ready to move on_.”


### Breath / Breathe

You **breathe** in and out. “_They seemed panicked, so I told them to just **breathe** deeply_.”

You can lose your **breath**, have bad **breath**, and take a **breath**. But you don't **breath**; you **breathe**.


### Moot point / mute point

**Moot** means meaningless or irrelevant. “_I mentioned all the ways NextJS is a poor choice for us, but it was a moot point, as it's too late to change now._”

**Mute** is commonly mistaken for moot, but it means silent or speechless. A point isn't **mute**.


### Rein / reign / rain

**Reins** are used to control a horse or other steed, and that's where many modern idioms come from. “_The presenter was losing the audience with her embellishments, so I told her to **rein** it in a bit_.” Or: “_Our CEO announced she'll be handing the **reins** over to a new leader._”

**Reign** is what a ruler does, and rain, of course, might fall on a parade.


### Wary / weary / leery

These may be the most commonly confused words on this list.

To be **wary** is to be cautious or skeptical; “_our vendor is promising a 200% improvement in performance if we sign with them now, but I'm **wary**_.”

**Leery** means the same thing: “_I'm **leery** of any company that makes such bold claims_.”

**Weary**, however, means "tired." “_I'm **weary** of these broken promises from our vendor_.” Weary is often mistakenly used instead of wary, though, probably because it sounds a lot like leery.


### I can't overstate / it can't be overstated

This phrase is very commonly messed up, because it uses a negative to make a positive statement, and so it can sound like you're saying the opposite of what you mean.

If you **can't overstate** something (or if it can't be overstated), that means no words could diminish its significance: “_I can't overstate the importance of sales growth this quarter_.”

But the negative "can't" in there confuses a lot of speakers. So avoid saying you _can_ overstate the importance, or confusing "overstate" with "understate." (_I can't understate_ would mean: it's absolutely trivial.)


### Per se / per say

This one is doubly tricky, because the original phrase is not only Latin, but it's _also_ commonly misused and misunderstood.

People commonly use **per se** to mean "exactly," as in: “_I wouldn't say I was mad about it, **per se**_.” But while that usage isn't always wrong, it isn't always right, either.

**Per se** _actually_ means "by itself," "on its own," or "intrinsically." If it helps: you can use the phrase **per se** anywhere you might use the phrase "in and of itself": “_I don't hate Tailwind **per se**, I just can't stand the culture around it_.” Or: “_the new HR software isn't bad **per se**, but people are having a hard time getting used to it_.”

**Per say**, as some people assume it's spelled, is actually not a phrase.


### Chock-full / chalk(ed) full

This is another one that's tricky because the main word in the phrase is a bit archaic.

A **chock** is a wooden wedge stuffed into a barrel to fill any empty gaps. Chocks were used to prevent the contents of barrels from shifting in transit, and to make sure there was no empty space for anything unwanted to get into.

So to say something is stuffed to the maximum, you say it's **chock-full**: “_that presentation was **chock-full** of useful information to take back to the team_.” (Notice it _is_ hyphenated, and it's not **chocked** full, because **chock** is a noun in this case, not a verb.)

**Chalk full** is not a phrase, and neither are **chocked/chalked full**. (You do, however, **chalk it up** to a misunderstanding.)


### Flesh out / flush out

You **flesh out** a loose concept or idea; “_we had a meeting to **flesh out** the design of the new feature in more detail_.”

You **flush out** something you want to be removed, especially from a hiding place. “_We were finally able to **flush out** the code causing those flaky CI errors_.”


### Elicit / illicit

Probably not as common as most of the mistakes on this list, but still worth a mention, since these homophones are easily confused.

To **elicit** is to evoke or draw out a reaction: “_the CEO's comments on diversity **elicited** some strong pushback_.”

**Illicit** means forbidden or illegal: “_we're not supposed to have games on our company laptops, but Todd installed an **illicit** copy of Balatro_.”


### Discrete / discreet

Even ardent grammar snobs get these two confused. (I have to look it up every time myself.)

**Discrete** means separate or distinct: “_our email is sent from a **discrete** server not connected with our main app_.”

**Discreet** means unobtrusive, careful, or concealed: “_our manager wasn't supposed to say anything, but they **discreetly** warned us layoffs might be coming_.”

A mnemonic to help remember the two: the one that means _separate_ has the E's at the end _separated_ by a T.

### Affect / effect

Another very common one, **affect** is transitive (meaning: it is done _to_ something or someone else), whereas **effect** is a noun; a thing that exists, rather than an action that is done.

“_The **effect** of the new PTO policy has been overwhelmingly damaging to morale. I can feel it **affecting** me, too._”

You are **affected**, or you feel the **effect**. A thing has an **effect**, or it is **affecting** people.


### Its / it's

There's only an apostrophe in the word "it's" when you can substitute the phrase "it is." Otherwise, omit the apostrophe—even when conveying possession.

**Right**: “_**It's** important to be correct._” (Because "it is" important; "it's" is a contraction.)

**Wrong**: “_The dog lost **it's** sweater._” (Omit the apostrophe, or use a different pronoun like _his_, _her_, or _their_ if you want to convey possession. Or, just rewrite the sentence to something like “the dog's sweater was lost.”)


### Then / than

An extremely common autocorrect fail. **Then** refers to time; **than** is a comparison.

“_I got some work done, **then** I played ping-pong_.”

“_I'd rather play ping-pong **than** go back to work_.”


### Literally

Look, I know everyone uses the word "literally" non-literally, but to be clear, it's best to avoid doing so. It can confuse the listener when a word is used as **literally** the opposite of its **literal** meaning.

Besides, it's just embellishment when used in this way, and so it really isn't adding anything meaningful to your sentence to begin with. So if you find yourself saying something like “_my boss **literally** bit my head off_,” maybe just leave that word out, or find a different word to use for emphasis (if for no other reason than one day, when you say something like “_the kitchen is **literally** on fire_,” people will know to take you seriously).
