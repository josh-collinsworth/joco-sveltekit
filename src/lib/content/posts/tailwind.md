If you've played [Mario Kart 8](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch/) on Switch, you might know the game offers a number of accessibility options to help younger and/or less skilled players enjoy the game alongside more competitive series veterans (such as myself).

One of those features is called [Smart Steering](https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-8-deluxe-smart-steering-how-to-turn-auto-steering-on-and-off), and it makes sure you never go off the track. Veer too far to the side of the road or get too close to an obstacle, and the game will momentarily take the wheel and autopilot away from disaster. No more driving backwards in the grass, or off the side of Rainbow Road; handy for anyone (_except possibly Carrie Underwood, who apparently [has Jesus for such occasions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus,_Take_the_Wheel)_).

Similarly, the game offers auto-acceleration, so that your racer constantly has their foot on the gas, and you don't need to manually hold down the corresponding button on the controller during a race. This eliminates a distraction for novice racers, and potentially offers even experienced players a nice option to save their thumbs some strain.

These accessibility options (and others) are wonderful additions to the game; indeed, they're what enable me and my young son to play together, and can help to even the playing field among any mixed group.

Once you've reached a certain skill threshold, however, Smart Steering stops helping, and actually starts getting in the way.

Smart Steering will prevent you from taking shortcuts, for one thing; it can't tell _why_ you're going off the main road, but it jumps in the way and prevents you from doing so regardless. It may even intervene when you didn't intend for it to, pushing you off your intended course at inopportune moments when assistance wasn't needed.

The same goes for auto-acceleration; there may be times you may _want_ to take a corner by strategically letting off the accelerator.

These options to _remove_ challenge, at a certain point, start _adding it in again_, and prevent you from going above a certain threshold.

I've been using Tailwind professionally, and even on the occasional hobby/learning project, for the better part of a year now. While I've understood why lots of developers seem to like it, and have seen that it does indeed have its compelling upsides, I've struggled for most of the last year to put into words what it is about this tool that just doesn't jive with me.

Something about Tailwind just feels like cutting against the grain; like doing things the wrong way around, at least as my brain has come to understand it.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

If you're sufficiently skilled, Tailwind feels like being forced to write CSS with Smart Steering on.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Sure, it helps some people, and that's great. Others just may not be looking for as deep an experience as I am, and that's fine, too.

But Tailwind doesn't help _me_; it gets in my way.

I know the tracks, and the shortcuts; I know where the pitfalls are, and how to get around them quickly and easily.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

When you force strong CSS developer to use Tailwind, _you are making them worse_. They are slower, they can do less, and they lose access to many of their most powerful techniques.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Tailwind proponents would undoubtedly point out that you can (and probably _should_) write CSS whenever you feel like it when using Tailwind. It doesn't prevent you from doing that, and maybe even expects it.

There are two main ways to do this:

1. Modify the Tailwind config file to insert your own utility classes and definitions into Tailwind; or
2. Just write CSS in its own file and link it up like you normally would.

the problem is: Tailwind isn't presented in this way; it's presented as _The Solution_ to CSS.

That's a bold claim, and so it begs a bold rebuttal: Tailwind isn't the solution to CSS any more than training wheels are the solution to bicycling. (Also: CSS doesn't _need_ a solution; it just needs careful, thoughtful architecture. Other programming languages require this as well, but for some reason, CSS is the only one that gets blamed for it.)

Noisy as the Tailwind crowd infamously may be, just about every frontend developer I know feels similarlyâ€”and I'm privileged to know a great many exceptionally talented frontend developers.

Given the choice, most of us would just as soon forego Tailwind altogether. (I think that's part of why the pro-Tailwind crowd seems so comparatively vocal; lots and lots of frontend developers can't even speak to Tailwind, because they've never had a compelling reason to even reach for it in the first place.)

Even those frontend developers I know who _do_ use Tailwind with some degree of regularity don't seem to be fans or evangelists, and instead, just find some value in Tailwind as a basic utility library; a supplement to their existing CSS, rather than as a totalitarian methodology.

I think it's because: when your CSS skills have reached a certain level, the Smart Steering and Auto Acceleration that Tailwind offers stop being benefits, and start being liabilities instead.

## What's good about Tailwind?

From what I've seen in working on various Tailwind projects over the last year or so (many of which at very large scale), the main appeal of Tailwind is: it unifies your team's approach to CSS. If anything is styled, you know how and where to find those styles. If you need to change something, you know where and how. Conflicts and side effects are minimized because there's (usually) little or no global styling; all of an elements styles are right there with the element markup.

That's a nice thing about Tailwind, I concede, but I've come to believe neither this nor any of Tailwind's benefits are actually unique to Tailwind itself.

Or, to put it another way:

<CalloutPlusQuote>

The good things about Tailwind aren't actually things about just Tailwind.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Having a framework is nice, but Tailwind isn't the only one; it just happens to be the most popular one right now. I think large companies especially are drawn to it for its semi-totalitarian opinions. Teams need to be on the same page, all working within the same system, and Tailwind is most certainly a system you could choose, with a happy path that's not exactly frictionless to leave.

So there's that; it helps unify teams. This, I think, is Tailwind's draw more than anything. Still, I also admit its utility classes are nice; I enjoy that I can quickly and easily add the basic margin, padding, border, color, etc. that I need to a basic element without jumping over to a CSS file to do it (though I _also_ think the benefit of reducing context switching is pretty dramatically overstated; more on that later).

In that same vein: theoretically, Tailwind speeds up prototyping by enabling you to style elements quickly. Even setting aside the upfront cost of _learning_ Tailwind to begin with, I find this assertion questionable (again: more on that later). Still, I can't deny that Tailwind _does_ have the power to speed up .

## Over-indexing on components

## Making rewrites harder

## The learning curve

## Not everything is possible

## Over-verbosity

## Inconsistent syntax

## It might feel good, but is it actually? (Or: was context switching really that much of a problem to begin with?)
