excerpt: "Along the vast divide between AI optimists and pessimists, the main factor in determining which side you fall on may be where you see yourself in society: above the effects of AI, or beneath them."

A while back, in a slightly earlier era of AI<footnote>What I really mean when I say “AI” is large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc. I realize the war is over and the terms are widely considered interchangeable at this point, but since AI originally meant something else—and since LLMs aren't actually intelligent—the pedantic side of me always feels compelled to make this distinction.</footnote>, a project was making the rounds which would read your GitHub profile, and create a personalized roast based on the contents.

It was intended, I assume, as a harmless, lighthearted novelty. I wanted to join in on the fun, so I put my profile in and tried it out.

I didn't laugh at my roast.

It wasn't clever, or funny, or even particularly unexpected. A tech-savvy stranger on Fiverr probably could've done better.

But more than that: I remember being surprised at how _mean_ it was. Little of what the model produced even felt like a joke; instead, it just read as a slew of very personal insults.

And _then_ I remember being surprised that the artificial cruelty actually _affected_ me.

Despite knowing this was all a soulless (and as it turns out, humorless) machine making a poor attempt at comedy—one that nobody else even saw!—reading those words hurt. Bizarrely, I suppose, AI actually managed to _hurt_ me.

And that was the first time I remember thinking about what AI was going to do to my _children_.

If I—a grown man with thick skin, hardened by decades of internet usage—can still be susceptible to highly personalized online bullying, what will it be like for my son, when some mean kid inevitably gets their hands on this technology and decides to put it to malicious use?

By the time my kids encounter _real_ bullying, I'm sure derogatory jokes will be about the _least_ harmful form of antagonism AI will be empowering. Imagine the damage one bad kid could cause using deepfakes, for example. Forget the days of starting a nasty rumor and spreading it around the school; now you can make a video of it happening.

Imagine the shame, intimidation, harassment, and trauma AI might enable a cruel juvenile to inflict—_particularly_ once the tech has had another few years to improve.<footnote>You don't actually have to imagine this; it's already happening.</footnote>

Imagine how absolutely unmitigable the damage would be.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

My reaction wasn't laughter; my reaction was horror at the realization that we're racing to build the perfect bullying tool.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

I was never exactly an optimist when it comes to AI. But that was the first time I realized exactly how dark the future I foresaw actually was.

Although it's not an entirely correct description, I'll use the term "AI optimist" a lot in this post, as it's at least a serviceable label for a general group of people.

That group, to be a bit more descriptive, is made up of people who are excited about AI, both present and future—but especially, they're happy about the _current_ and near-term state of AI. You might call them enthusiasts, or even believers, maybe. But in any case, they generally consider the current state of the technology to be good, and either aren't aware of the bad parts, or aren't overly concerned with them.

You almost certainly know at least one or two of these people. Maybe you even _are_ one. (If so: I'm not naive enough to think I'll change your mind with this post, but I hope I'll at least give you some things to think about.)

It seems to me that to be in this group—to regard AI, as it exists currently, with optimism and enthusiasm—requires at least a certain degree of class privilege. Hence, the somewhat blunted title of this post.

I had long struggled to put the thought into words. But once it crystallized into this post's titular sentence, I felt as though a great deal around me suddenly shifted into perspective.

So, that's why I wrote this post; to share that perspective. It is my own, and it comes from my own experiences (and yes, through the lens of my own substantial privileges, class and otherwise). You can take it, or not, as you like.

It's late 2025, and so you don't need me to tell you how extreme opposing views on AI can be. _Everyone_ has an opinion of AI, and the overwhelming majority fall to one far end of the spectrum or the other. There's a vast divide between the sides, each fiercely passionate in their own entirely opposite ways.

For my part, I'm decidedly on the pessimist side of the chasm, for many reasons. Some I'll get into here; others, I'll mostly pass over, as they've been well covered elsewhere.

But for now, suffice to say: when I look around me at the impact AI is _currently_ having, I see little reason for enthusiasm—let alone the little-questioned, quasi-religious belief that this fundamentally flawed technology will one day soon bring about some sort of economic, societal, and/or scientific revolution all on its own.

Come to think of it, "religious" might be a good word to describe how AI optimism feels, from the outside. It has fervent believers, prophecies from prominent figures to be taken on faith, and—of course, as with any religion—a central object of worship which can at all times be offered as The Answer, no matter what the question might happen to be.

In fairness: that's not all AI optimists. I'm mostly describing the extreme ones.

Even among the more moderate optimists, though—the fairly ordinary people who just seem to like the tech—the enthusiasm has always seemed…disproportionate, let's say.

It was always perplexing to me that so many of my peers seemed so eager to be across the divide from me. They didn't seem particularly different than me. In fact, many were my friends, connections, and people I looked up to.

We were looking at the same tech, with the same outcomes, and drawing entirely different conclusions. What was I missing?

The answer eventually hit me:

They see themselves as the ones benefiting from AI, and not as the ones it might cost.

They see themselves in a class of people who are _safe_.

I concede AI can occasionally be helpful for certain tasks, and I can understand the enthusiasm, as far as that goes. I don't use it often, but admittedly some. I find it helpful for generating reference images to use as starting points for illustrations, and occasionally for ideating, as a "rubber duck" of sorts. I also use it once in a while to compensate for my own color vision deficiency. But mostly, it helps me with code.

Even if my new coding buddy is severely prone to overconfidence (and hallucination, and vulnerabilities, and counter-productivity…), it's still admittedly exciting when it makes tasks that would've been previously time-consuming and/or challenging quick and easy.

In order to be an AI optimist about this, however: that's where I would have to stop thinking about it.

I would be forced to ignore what _else_ my little coding buddy is getting up to when I'm not looking; the _other_ impacts he's having on _other_ people's lives.

Let's take layoffs, as an example.

In order to be an AI optimist, it seems to me you'd have to believe yours is not among the jobs that risk being automated or downsized, and that you aren't among the countless workers staring down displacement. After all, how could you feel enthusiastic about a threat to your own livelihood?<footnote>AI's ability to replace workers is overstated, it should be noted. It can handle some tasks, of course, but workers do—and are—a great deal more than the sum of a task list, as some companies who have been forced to re-hire after layoffs have already discovered. Unfortunately, however, most executives still don't seem to be deterred from trying.</footnote>

You'd need to be high enough in the org chart; far enough up the pyramid; advanced enough along the career ladder.

To be an AI optimist, I'm guessing you must not be worried about where your next job might come from, or whether you can even find one. The current dire state of the job market, I have to assume, doesn't scare you. You must feel secure.

Maybe it's because you've already made a name for yourself. Maybe you're known at conferences, or on podcasts. Maybe you're just senior enough that you don't need to worry about being hireable anymore; you can take that for granted.

You almost certainly aren't a junior, though, or an intern, or somebody trying to break into the field. You must not be near the rising tide engulfing entry-level workers across my industry and a wide range of others. Because, infamously, _nobody_ is hiring juniors anymore.<footnote>Trying to replace juniors with AI is a doubly perilous gamble, because you have to believe it can not only replace your juniors now, but replace the seniors they'd eventually grow into, on top of taking over for your existing seniors when they move on and their positions need to be filled. It's closing up the entire talent pipeline all at once. I, for one, wouldn't want to be responsible for that bet.</footnote>

<CalloutPlusQuote>

It seems fairly safe to assume you aren't in the first group against the wall, if you're excited about the thing putting them there.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

You probably aren't a contractor, either, or working at a consultancy. And for that matter: you almost _certainly_ aren't an artist, or illustrator, or writer. You probably haven't watched clients evaporate as their dollars are funnelled upwards, somewhere beyond and above you, knowing the AI-fueled disruption bankrupting you is only possible because it plagiarized you and a million other people who do what you do.

AI optimism probably means you're in a position where nobody is stealing _your_ work, or bulldozing _your_ entire career field.

It probably means nobody is _forcing_ you to use AI—or especially, to fix something AI-generated, as part of your job. You probably aren't watching a career you once enjoyed suddenly morph into something very different than what you signed up for, as you shift away from doing fulfilling work, and instead spend your days micro-managing an error-prone machine, laboriously correcting its unending mistakes.

I guess it also probably means you're not a student anymore. Or, for that matter, a teacher. Because it's _bleak_ being in education right now, on either side.

Thanks largely to AI, students are looking at the worst job market since 2008, and teachers, they tell us repeatedly and desperately, are working in the most difficult learning environment since 2020.

Not that other technologies haven't previously made either position difficult, of course, or that AI is the sole cause of any of this. But I think it would be dishonest, and a disservice to both groups, to treat AI as merely another new flavor of distraction and disruption, when it seems like teachers everywhere are feverishly ringing alarm bells over what it's doing to their students and to their institutions.

I guess to be optimistic about AI, I'd have to forget about all that. Which, admittedly, would be easier, now that I'm not a student _or_ a teacher anymore; now that both groups are merely abstract crowds of strangers, rather than groups I belong to, or that include people I know.

That's the thing about being bullish on AI: to focus on its benefits to you, you're forced to ignore its costs to others.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

AI optimism requires believing that you (and your loved ones) are not among those who will be driven to psychosis, to violence, or even to suicide by LLM usage. At the very least, this means you feel secure in your own mental health; likely, it also means you have a wider and more substantial support system propping up your wellbeing.

(Not to put too fine a point on it, but: those things are otherwise known as privileges.)

AI optimism requires you to believe that, whoever will be impacted by the sprawling data centers, the massive electricity demands, the water consumption, and the other environmental hazards of the AI boom<footnote>I realize it's difficult to pin down the environmental impact and energy costs of AI, and that there's a wide range of estimates out there. Even if the impact is ultimately comparatively small, however—and I very much doubt that, given the frustrating opacity from AI companies, but even if that's the case—we're still currently at a worrying scale, well above what we would be without AI, at a time when our planet is already being pushed well beyond what we can afford. Besides: I saw two different news stories just yesterday, about two different data centers in two different parts of the US, potentially causing rare cancers and miscarriages in the inhabitants of nearby cities. So regardless of wider environmental impacts, we likely have other harms to reckon with.</footnote>, it won't be you. Whatever disaster might happen, your house, in your neighborhood, will be safe from it. Probably far from it.

---

The harms of AI aren't a standalone issue; as AI becomes a part of _other_ technologies, systems, and parts of society, it's exacerbating their existing problems, and accelerating damage already being done elsewhere.

I have to believe scammers are enthusiastic about AI; there's likely never been a more helpful tool for fraud. Criminals and con artists have always been around, of course, but they've never had such powerful instruments at their disposal. It's much easier to rob somebody's unsuspecting grandma when you can simply make a video of them out of thin air, or perfectly imitate their voice on a phone call.<footnote>Not to perpetuate the stereotype; everybody is vulnerable, and even the most tech-savvy people I know have fallen victim to sophisticated scams.</footnote>

But that's a relatively small scale of harms, aimed at individuals. The larger harms generally come from AI interacting with _systems_, like governments and their substructures.

Malicious state actors (both in and outside of the US) are wielding AI as a ruthlessly efficient propaganda machine, disseminating disinformation that's more convincing than ever, faster than ever previously possible. Much of what's being produced serves to dehumanize and victimize vulnerable groups, like immigrants, refugees, queer people, and political dissidents. Mainly (but not exclusively), this is to bolster authoritarian power.

It's hard to imagine how one could be optimistic about the technology empowering such horrors, but I suppose knowing it probably won't affect you must help.

I doubt I could feel very good about the tech helping me write emails faster if I knew that same tech was helping to make me, or people close to me, a target of violence.

Even when the intent might be good, however, AI often amplifies existing harms.

In the rush to shove AI into everything possible, we've now injected it into parts of the justice system, too. It's in everything from facial recognition and surveillance tech to data and administrative work. It's even in the legal system.

In theory, this is an efficiency boost. In _theory_, a machine should be less biased than humans.

In reality, not only do these models make mistakes at a rate that is utterly unacceptable in this context; they mimic and amplify the inherent racism present in their own training data. (Tech is always a mirror of its creators; it is never neutral.) Compounding this problem, AI is non-deterministic, and something of a black box, offering little to no way to inspect, challenge, or appeal its results.

Needless to say, this deployment of AI has already had profoundly devastating impact on real people's lives—damage which shows no signs of slowing.

Forgive me, but I can't imagine being excited that this technology which is rapidly accelerating inequality is also helping me save a little time on writing code.

I have to imagine such excitement would require me to think none of this could happen to _me_, or to anybody who matters to me.

Or, at the very least: that it's all undeniably unfortunate, but ultimately, in service to some greater good. A justifiable tradeoff; a glitch to be ironed out.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

AI optimism requires you to see the lives of at least some of your fellow humans as worthwhile sacrifices; bug reports in a backlog.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

But even when there's no larger system behind it, and even with no broader goal or agenda at all—malicious or otherwise—AI can still amplify existing harms.

One example at the top of my mind: Facebook was recently flooded with AI-generated videos of women being violently strangled. There was no apparent deeper purpose behind this horrifying wave of misogynistic terrorism, however; it just happened to be what the algorithm rewarded. That content generated engagement, and that engagement generated more of the same content.

A similar thing happened recently on TikTok, but this time it was videos of immigrants being ruthlessly brutalized that struck a nerve and triggered a proliferation of objectionable content across the platform.

Sometimes this effect is more or less benign (see: Shrimp Jesus); other times, a machine built to provoke a reaction will inevitably hit paydirt in the horrifying, the traumatizing, the inhumane, and the unacceptable.

AI isn't just harmful on its own; it's a force multiplier for existing harms. The intent behind it, if one even exists, is irrelevant; the impact is the same.

The question is: what sort of viewpoint must it take to see all of this as merely a negligible side effect? Just the cost of business?

What would vibe coding need to accomplish, in order to make all of this seem worth it?

Some might argue I'm missing the entire point here, by focusing so much on the present. Optimism isn't about the present, they might say; it's about the future!

Forget what AI actually is _now_; the models will get better, the data centers more energy-efficient, the tokens cheaper, the mistakes rarer, the harms mitigated, and so on, until we have something that changes the world for the better; an actual benevolent technology that solves our problems, in whatever way. Maybe it even is, or leads to, AGI (actual human-level artificial intelligence; the thing AI used to mean before 2022).

I take issue with these predictions, for several reasons:

- While I'm sure it's true the technology and its costs will continue to improve, it's hard to see how that would mitigate most of these harms. Many would just as likely be _intensified_ by greater speed, efficiency, and affordability.

- I'm wary of predictions in general,<footnote>Anyone can predict anything. I predict this post will win the Pulitzer. There, see?</footnote> but particularly those that bear little to no resemblance to observed
 reality. Absent a clear evidential link, prediction tends to be based purely on hype and speculation, and there's a wild overabundance of both around AI.

  It's reasonable to believe the tech will improve. It seems much less reasonable to think it might suddenly change into something new, develop presently impossible capabilities, or take us somewhere far distant with absolutely no clear path or connection between here and there.

- Most of the utopian visions of AI center on the idea that AI is sentient, which it categorically, factually, _is not_. Language and statistics can simply mimic cognition easily, and our human brains are overly eager to anthropomorphize anything that vaguely imitates human behavior. Thinking and reasoning are very different than statistically emulating communication.<footnote>You might notice the people who argue that AI is sentient tend to be on the tech side of things, and not people who actually study things like cognition, intelligence, etc. as their actual academic career. There are many such experts, across a wide range of fields—like neuroscience, for example—and most of them say we still don't really understand the brain yet. But you might also notice it rarely occurs to tech people to even ask a real expert. Most just assume being an expert in code also makes them an expert in everything else, too, and confidently assert they do understand brains, actually, and have made one.</footnote>

- Many LLM experts, including OpenAI's own researchers, tell us the models are already approaching their realistic ceiling, thanks in no small part to the exhaustion of training data that is not already tainted with AI content. They also tell us it's literally impossible to stop LLMs from making things up. (Really: actual people from OpenAI publicly admitted LLMs will never stop lying. It's an un-fixable bug, because it's a core component of how LLMs work.)

- Even if we ignore all the technical limitations, or find ways around them: new advancements simply don't work that way. They never have. (The equitable, worker-liberating way, that is.) Tech doesn't free workers; it forces them to do more in the same amount of time, for the same rate of pay or less.

  If you become twice as productive, you don't get twice the pay or twice the time off; you just get twice the workload—likely because somebody else doing the same job just got laid off, and now you're doing their work, too.

  This sort of technology distributes instability to the many at the bottom, while consolidating benefit at the top—and there has arguably never been a more efficient mechanism for this than AI. I see absolutely no reason to believe this time will be different, _especially_ because:

- AI models exist in the consolidated hands of a precious few huge companies, which are themselves quite obviously happy to do away with as many of their own workers as they possibly can. AI will serve, and is already serving, corporate interests first and foremost—_especially_ as these models continue to replace core infrastructure, like web search, and can be manipulated however the companies please.<footnote>If you don't believe the output of AI can be molded to fit the agenda of a single person or corporation, I encourage you to have a look at what Grok has been up to lately.</footnote>

- Regardless, even if you naively believe in the tech: you're _still_ willing to put up with all the harms and dangers of AI until that imagined potential future arrives—which brings us back to the original point.

Some might also point to positive use cases for AI. Accessibility is a popular one. (In fact, it's _so_ popular that online AI apologists have realized all they need to do is invoke the word "ableist" to shut down any discussion.)

Yes, there are good use cases for AI. I don't think most reasonable people would argue with that. Like I said: I sometimes even use it myself, to compensate for my own physical inability. But calling out such cases tends to be a bad-faith attempt to justify all of AI's other harms by _using_ disabled people and others who might benefit from AI, rather than reckoning with the damage and rethinking our deployment of AI in order to maximize good and minimize harm for _everyone_. We don't have to accept every use of AI and all of its impacts just because some of them might be beneficial.

Finally, let me take a moment to address anyone who might be thinking: _sure, AI is being used for some bad things, but I'm not personally using it that way. What's wrong with me just focusing on the good parts and enjoying the benefits to me_?

My friend, that's privilege. You are literally describing privilege.

Let me close this post the same way it began; with a personal example from my own family.

I have a newborn daughter.

I began writing this post before she was born, and mostly because of her, I'm now finishing it up several weeks later. (I've fit most of this writing into her nap schedule, typing as she sleeps beside me.)

And I can't shake the thought that I'm welcoming her into a world where so much of the potential malicious misuse of AI could one day be directed at her.

Looking beyond all the things we've already talked about: technology in general has made things like stalking and abuse easier than ever. But AI goes even further. I live knowing AI will allow any degenerate pervert with an internet connection to create deepfakes of this little girl—up to and including pornography—without any consent at all, at barely the click of a button.

If this sounds like a horrifying, disturbed thought: it is! _It absolutely is_! But I'm not coming up with this on my own; this is already happening to untold numbers of women, many of whom are school-aged girls.

To be an AI optimist, I would need to turn away from this. Ignore it. Consider it all just part of the plan; a price to be casually paid (hopefully by somebody else) in exchange for…what? Writing software a little bit faster?<footnote>For the sake of brevity, I write as though I accept the premise that AI provides a productivity boost. However, there's significant evidence that AI actually only makes you feel more productive, while in fact, it slows you down. This matches my own experience; I often end up spending significantly more time trying to fix what AI has generated than I would've spent just doing it all myself in the first place. But that's another post.</footnote>

Optimism would require me to believe that my children probably won't have that kind of experience, or any others I've described here.

To believe they'll be in better schools. Better neighborhoods. Have better friends. Better support systems.

Won't ever attract the attention of the wrong guy, or piss off the wrong girl.

Won't ever live in the wrong places. Won't ever find themselves in the wrong part of the system.

Won't end up on the wrong side of the accelerated inequality.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

AI optimism requires you to see yourself and your loved ones as safe from AI; as the passengers in the self-driving car, and not as the pedestrians it might run over.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

I don't know how you see yourself that way without a great deal of class privilege.

The rest of us?

I guess it's hard to see the convenience as worth the price—let alone exciting—when you know you could be among the ones paying for it.
