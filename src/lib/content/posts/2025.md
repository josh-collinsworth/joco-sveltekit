excerpt: A look back on 2025, and all the weird, wonderful things that happened in my year.
---

My story of 2025 doesn't really begin in 2025, so I don't think I can begin this year in review without talking about the previous year first.

(_Note: this post does include my traditional list of stuff I enjoyed this year, but I decided to include this personal look back first. You can <a href="#tv-shows">skip down to the list here</a>, if you just want to get to the stuff I watched, played, read, and bought this year_.)

Last year, in 2024, my wife turned 39, and we decided we wanted to at least _try_ to have another kid, while we still could, before that door was permanently closed for us by the risks and realities of time.

We knew the odds weren't exactly in our favor. We needed fertility treatment to have our first, and even back then (several years younger), it was a long and often heart-wrenching process. We knew this time around wouldn't be easier.

And so we spent much of 2024 in all the slow-motion trauma of various fertility treatments. We were in and out of doctors' offices. My wife was constantly giving herself painful injections of medications that showed up by the boxload, and when she couldn't administer them herself, I had to. Side effects proliferated. She was rarely _not_ in pain. Sometimes that's why she was crying; sometimes it wasn't.

There were tests and lab work followed by more tests and more lab work. Appointments with cheery nurses, followed by meetings with solemn doctors. Weeks of waiting, glimmers of hope, but all for nothing, eventually.<footnote>And this is all, of course, from the _privileged_ position of being able to afford fertility treatment in the first place.</footnote>

Yet another bad roll of the dice; yet another trip back to square one.

At the very beginning of all of it, we promised each other: _we'll be happy no matter what happens_. If we're able to have another kid, that's wonderful, and we'll welcome that baby into our lives with love and gratitude. But if not, we can be happy and grateful with the life and the family we already have.

We can't lose, we said.

Towards the end of the year, however, we felt as though we had indeed lost—or at least, played a game where there was no winning.

We'd put ourselves through enough. We saw little to no reason to continue; no compelling hope worth torturing ourselves.

So we settled in, and in the final weeks of the year, we made peace with that closed door. We spent the holidays saying a melancholy goodbye to those possibilities, while enjoying our present life together, just the three of us.

We adjusted our vision of the future. And we were, in the end, happy with that, despite all the heartbreaks.

---

So that was the end of our 2024; giving up on that hope (and a number of others that most of us know and feel, and that we don't need to get into here).

Then, in January of this year, we took another devastating blow. Griff, our beloved dog of 13 years, passed away. [I wrote about losing Griff](/blog/goodbye-griff) back then. It was a dark time, and we still miss him painfully to this day. But we got through it, the three of us.

Once some time had passed, we adopted a new dog, who we called Milo. But to make a long story short, we weren't the right home for him. Despite our best efforts, it was painfully obvious he was never remotely comfortable in our home.

It turns out, Milo needed _other_ dogs, and that was a responsibility we just weren't ready to take on. So we helped to find Milo a new home, with two other dogs, where he's thriving. Our attempted adoption turned out to be just a three-month foster, but that's ok.

2025 was definitely not our year, dog-wise. I think a new dog will probably find a home in our house and hearts again in the future. (Maybe even next year? We'll see.)

In the meantime, we thought: at least we've got the three of us.

Then, something wildly unexpected happened.

Miraculously, unexpectedly, unbelievably: we got pregnant all on our own (though we didn't actually realize it until the world's most cliché case of morning sickness appeared several weeks later, and I made multiple trips to the nearest CVS to make sure _all_ the pregnancy tests were actually working right).

Suddenly and impossibly, after so many failed attempts to force that immovable boulder up the hill, it just teleported itself up there all on its own.

The idea was an adjustment, to say the least. Bizarrely, after spending the whole previous year _trying_ in every possible way for the thing we were just suddenly and miraculously handed, it was...almost _heartbreaking_, somehow?

It was jolting. We'd just closed that door. We'd just made peace with never seeing the vision of the future that was now abruptly sitting right in front of us.

Was this _actually_ good? Or was this just the worst letdown yet, waiting to happen?

We didn't dare hope, at first. There are no guarantees even in the best of circumstances, let alone when you're pregnant on your 40th birthday.

We live in a red state, where abortion is only legal for the first 22 weeks of pregnancy. We wondered: what happens if something goes wrong? Can my wife actually get the care she needs from doctors who might be afraid of overzealous right-wing lawyers, if the unthinkable happens after that initial 22 weeks?

I had a long, thorough article bookmarked, on how to talk doctors into providing your pregnant partner with care (or passing her off to doctors who will), and how to make sure they don't let her die if complications arise. People who had been through it—and in many cases lost partners—shared all the things they wish they would've known. I read it multiple times. I made sure it was available on my phone. I even saved it as a PDF, in case I was in a hospital or an ambulance or a helicopter, and didn't have a signal.

This goes without saying, but: nobody should ever have to do that.

But week after week went by. Bad things kept failing to happen. Milestones kept passing without incident. And soon, impossibility became casual reality: _we're going to have a baby by the end of this year._

---

Our baby girl, Delainey, arrived in mid October. It turns out I didn't need that article after all—although my wife _did_ endure several extra days of postpartum torture in a prison cell of a hospital room over preeclampsia concerns. It seemed quite obvious to me this was much more about the hospital covering its own ass legally than it was out of any sincere concern for _her_ wellbeing, but in the fear of the moment, you don't dare take a chance, no matter how awful things get. (And they did get _awful_.)

Thankfully, in the end, her blood pressure recovered. She's healthy, and there were no other major issues with the birth.

And now the three of us is the four of us.

I'm fortunate to have been able to spend the final ten weeks or so of the year on paternity leave, supporting that family and spending time with my daughter in these early days of her life.

The days are long, but somehow never long enough.

---

Life with a newborn has been both easier than I remembered, and even more excruciating, all at once. I guess knowing what to expect helps, even when the reality somehow turns out to be even worse than you remembered.

The first few months of our son's life were unquestionably the darkest in mine. I don't know that my daughter's newborn days quite compare, but I definitely won't miss these nights, regardless.

As I write this, we're about 10 weeks in—but we're all healthy, which is all anyone can really hope for, I suppose. She's brought her own challenges even beyond the usual newborn stuff (I'll spare the details of physical therapy and minor oral surgery), but all is well now, and we're on a good path. I'm sure there are some difficult days ahead, but it all seems manageable. Hopefully, we'll be leaving the hardest parts of her first year in 2025.

It's easy to lose focus in the thick of the newborn haze, and the three full-time jobs babies are, but Delainey is a delight. We're unbelievably fortunate.

As for my wife and I: we haven't gotten up to much since that October day. In fact, we pretty much get in bed at 7pm now, which means we're not watching much TV, and I'm not playing many video games or doing many side projects.

But here's what I _did_ get up to for the rest of the year, before our lives shut down temporarily.


## Travel

It was a great year for traveling, as we tried to get some extra miles in before the baby arrived.

We took the opportunity to visit Tulsa over our son's spring break, and had a great time exploring the impressive outdoor [Gathering Place](https://www.gatheringplace.org/).

For my wife's 40th, we decided to book an Airbnb just off Lake Michigan, and spent a wonderful week with some family friends there, on the beach, and exploring the nearby towns.

Over the 4th of July, we made our annual trip to Sewanee, Tennessee to visit family, and enjoyed staying in a gorgeous old home overlooking a scenic bluff in the mountains.

For work, I got to spend a week in the spring in Chicago, and one in Rotterdam in the fall. Neither trip involved a lot of touristy stuff, but I did get to catch a Cubs game at Wrigley Field, and had the opportunity to sightsee in Amsterdam, and ride bikes around Rotterdam, both of which were absolute delights. And, of course, with Deno being a fully remote company, it's always good to see coworkers in real life.


## Work life

As mentioned, I got to take two trips this year with Deno. Project-wise, I got to be part of the official rollout of the completely reworked, all-new [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). The brand itself was a collaborative effort between myself and John Donmoyer, Deno's (real) designer, but the logo itself—featuring the new hatching dino "DeeDee" character—is an original work I'm especially proud of.

<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; padding: 2rem; margin-block: var(--quarter-note); background: var(--neutral-white);"><img style="width: 100%; max-width: 16rem; margin-inline: auto;" src="/images/post_images/deno-deploy-logo.svg" alt="The new Deno Deploy logo, featuring a cartoonish dinosaur peeking out from a hatched egg" /></div>

I also got the chance to work on a partial rebuild of the [Deno Docs site](https://docs.deno.com), and take on some very fun illustration and animation projects, on top of the normal web and product projects. (Some of them didn't wrap up before I went on paternity leave, but I'm excited to pick back up where I left off once I return.)

## Family stuff

Aside from all the above, my son had a busy year, ending kindergarten and beginning first grade. He played basketball, baseball, and soccer. We went to Scouts camp. He got to see his first Royals game. He started riding a bike and occasionally even roller skating. He's reading books on his own, playing games, and solving puzzles at well ahead of his age. (He can even do the easier _Clues by Sam_ puzzles all on his own.) He's energetic, imaginative, smart, kind, and frequently hilarious.

On top of it all, he's been an excellent big brother, and commonly a big help to his overwhelmed parents. I know all parents brag about their kids, but I've gotten a decent sample size of other kids his age now, and I'm here to tell you I've got an objectively exceptional one (whose new little sister can't take her eyes off him; she often lights up smiling at his ridiculous antics).

My wife and I had a challenging year, for lots of reasons, but that which did not kill us did indeed make us stronger. I feel really good about where we are headed into 2026.

---

All right, that's the end of the autobiographical look back at the year. From here on out, this will just be my traditional "things I enjoyed this year" list.


## TV Shows

Again, a much shorter list than in some previous years (even before Delainey arrived, my wife regularly fell asleep immediately once the TV turned on when she was pregnant), but here's the little bit we managed to squeeze in that wasn't purely for background noise.


### Severance

Season 2 of Severance is easily my favorite thing I watched in 2025. It's an absolute masterpiece of a show and I almost don't even care how things wrap up. It's perfect, the cast is perfect, the tension is perfect, and more than anything else: the disturbing idea that we might all be better people if we had no idea who we were has haunted me ever since I watched it.

### Abbott Elementary

Once our go-to background show, _Abbott_ quickly became a beloved staple. My wife and I binged every episode in 2025. It's hilarious, but it's also on a level above traditional network TV sitcom fare in every category. It makes you care about every character (even the ones you're sure you hate).


### Silo

Season 2 of Silo takes a while to get going, but it builds on the promise of season one and keeps escalating until the mind-blowing finale.

Season 1 of Silo tells the story of people living their lives in a postapocalyptic bunker, and who have been doing so for long enough that they don't even really have any idea why they're there or what happened; they just know they can't go outside.

Season two picks up with an exile from our original bunker finding out hers is not the only one, and uncovering the story of one of the others. It ends with a peek at how all of this might have begun in the first place, and what's _really_ going on in the world beyond.

One of my absolute favorite sci-fi/drama series of the last several years, and highly recommended for just about anyone.


### Bad sisters

A dark comedy (at times _very_ dark) that follows the misadventures of four Irish sisters who are determined to free their fifth sister from her abusive husband by killing him. JP, the husband in question, is quite possibly the most hate-worthy character in TV history, and so you can't help but root for the sisters' success. But the twist is: while we know from the beginning of the series that JP does indeed die in the end, we don't know _how_, or which of the many plots the sisters spring might succeed (if any).

### Laid

Though it was cancelled after only one season, I highly enjoyed this (yet another) dark comedy about Ruby, a self-absorbed woman who carelessly flits between relationships, rarely even remembering the people she was with or realizing she hurt them. But one day, Ruby realizes every guy she's ever been with is suddenly dying, as if by tragic curse, in the exact order she was with them.

Ruby and her best friend AJ (a true crime enthusiast played by Zosia Mamet) frantically try to figure out what caused this bizarre curse, and how to save the remaining men on Ruby's list.

The dark humor makes for some hilarious moments, and there are some unexpectedly delightful cameos and twists in Ruby's journey to become a better person. Too bad it ended too soon.

### True crime docuseries

#### Scamanda

I'm a big fan of true crime documentaries where the crime in question is a scam, and few series have such a brazen con (or con artist) at their center as this one. I won't ruin it by saying any more.

#### Betrayal

_Betrayal_ focuses on somebody who turned out to be someone disturbingly different than their family believed. Season three, new this year, is one I found unforgettably disturbing.

#### Stalking Samantha: 13 Years of Terror

The horrifying story of a case of stalking that went on for 13 years and culminated in an unspeakable kidnapping.


### Also watched (but didn't like as much)

- Both seasons of _9 Perfect Strangers_ were fairly interesting, even if I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. (It's basically a poor man's _White Lotus_.)

- _Paradise_ is kinda meh, honestly—it feels like a basic network drama that desperately wants to be a prestige show—but despite falling into some tropes, it at least takes some interesting swings, and the cast is great.


## Games

A whole lot of my year was spent playing games of various kinds; video games (both solo and with my kid), tabletop games (mostly with family), and, of course, daily puzzle games. So I've broken this section down into those three main categories.


### Video games

Incidentally: my Switch 2 is absolutely my favorite thing I bought this year. It far surpassed my expectations, and it's so game-changing having upgraded graphics and performance (_literally_), I probably could've contentedly played nothing but upgraded Switch 1 games for the rest of the year. (I usually play in handheld mode, [using these grips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F48HPY7B), and travel with it using the included carry case.)

My favorite games of the year:

#### Shogun Showdown

In my mind, _Shogun Showdown_ is about the perfect balance of minimalism and depth.

The game could be described as a turn-based strategy roguelite, with slight deck-building elements. But if that jargon means nothing to you: it's really just a strategy game about anticipating your enemies' moves.

Battles take place on a 2-D plane with a limited number of spaces. So you (and your foes) can only move and attack left or right.

Every turn, you get one action, and so does each enemy on the field: you can move; queue up an attack from your deck; unleash all the attacks in your queue; turn around; or use your character's special ability (like swapping places with a nearby foe). The twist is: similarly to _Slay the Spire_ and _Into the Breach_, you can see what move your enemies are about to make, and your action will always resolve _first_. So your success will come from using this foresight to dodge, preempt, or even redirect attacks and force your foes into damaging each other.

Between battles, of course, you can power up your deck, buy items, and choose which path to take to the next fight, until your run eventually ends either in defeat or at the final showdown with (who else?) the Shogun.

The core gameplay is extremely simple in the best possible way, but there's enough depth and strategy involved to keep the game interesting for dozens of runs and beyond. Probably my personal pick for the most underrated game of 2025. [_Edit: I see now this game actually came out on Switch in September 2024, but I didn't play it until this year_.]


#### Blue Prince

One of the best puzzle games I've ever played, with a crazy premise that somehow works.

In _Blue Prince_, you assume the role of a boy whose eccentric uncle has bequeathed him a sprawling mansion full of mysteries—but only on the condition that he can find its hidden secret room.

There are 45 rooms in the mansion, aligned in a tight 5×9 grid. The twist is: every day, the rooms are _different_. Every time you open a door, you get a choice of three possible rooms that could be on the other side, each with their own benefits, costs, and exits further into the mansion.

The ostensible goal of the game is to find the hidden 46th room and gain entry, which may take you dozens of runs and many, many hours all on its own. But as with any good puzzle game, the mysteries are really only just beginning when you finally hit that first rewarding goal, and there's a world of other secrets to uncover in this house, and in the story you piece together from photos and journal entries.


#### Ball X Pit

Barely more than a glorified iPhone game, yet one of my most-enjoyed games this year. I don't know why it's so fun bouncing a bunch balls off enemies to do damage. Maybe it's how every ball is different, and they have effects like ice and lightning. Maybe it's how you can upgrade those balls, and even combine them to get even more devastating bouncy forms. Maybe it's the roguelike aspect, or the gradual upgrades that make you more powerful over time.

I don't know. I just know it's fun as hell and endlessly satisfying to play.


#### Hades II

Although it stands as a lesson that adding more to a game is not the same as adding more to the experience, _Hades 2_ is still one of the standouts of the year for me. For both better and for worse, everything in the original is doubled here. This means there's far more to do, and breathtakingly upgraded visuals, but it also means the game can feel like a grind at times.

Nonetheless, it was an absolute joy to rediscover the characters and settings from the original _Hades_, and get to know new faces and locations in that world. (Also: Skelly, returning in disguise as General Schelemeus, is probably my favorite character in any game this year.)


#### Mario Kart World

Like many people, I didn't care for _Mario Kart World_ at first, but it grew on me over time. I think it was natural to expect it to be more like its predecessor, _Mario Kart 8_, but that game nailed the formula so well, I see now there was little point in setting out to make a repeat.

Instead, we get a gorgeous little world where you _can_ still do three-lap races, if that's what you like, but where the real appeal is _Mad Max_-style caravans across the widely varied terrain, with 24 racers at a time jockeying for position as they race down the road. The _Knockout Tour_ mode is the real star here, although free roam mode is a fun time-killer, too.


#### Silksong

Although _Silksong_ might have been my most-played game of 2025, if I'm being honest, it's one of the games I actually enjoyed the _least_.

The original _Hollow Knight_ is easily one of my all-time favorite games, but _Silksong_ doubled down on all the wrong parts of it, in my opinion. In fact, I came close to omitting this game from my list entirely, because _so much_ of my experience with it was sheer frustration.

I don't want to dwell too much on this one entry, but: games that don't offer difficulty controls should be a thing of the past, IMO. I'm a dad. I get, at best, an hour or two for games in the evening, when I'm already tired. I don't want to spend that entire window failing repeatedly at the same boss, or doing the same runback over and over. I might have felt differently in my younger years, but right now, I want to be able to _enjoy_ the game I'm playing, and Silksong is intransigent in forcing you to play it one extremely specific way, tailored for one extremely specific segment of its audience.

(_While we're on the topic: games with save points should be a thing of the past, too. “Sorry, son, we can't play_ Mario Kart _because Dad paused his game and doesn't want to lose his progress” isn't a thing I should ever have to say in the year 2025._ )

Nonetheless, I grinded _Silksong_ until I got the good ending, but that was much more compulsion than any sense of enjoyment or satisfaction.

I have to imagine I'll start a new file at some point, and maybe I'll appreciate _Silksong_ a little more once I know what I'm in for, and bring some experience with me. (In fairness: I hated _Hollow Knight_ at first, too.)

Regardless: I wish game makers wouldn't try to stubbornly force every player to be exactly alike, and would instead meet players where they are, and allow them to start where they're comfortable. Then, those who want to can graduate to the "normal" difficulty once they're ready, while everyone else can just start there.

(In my field, we refer to this as "accessibility." The video game industry could use a bit more of it, in my opinion.)


#### Boomerang Fu

This is a party game that I mostly bought to play with my 6-year-old, and boy did it pay off in that regard. It's a frenetic but straightforward free-for-all, with highly customizable rules and simple controls that make it easy for anyone to pick up and play, while allowing seasoned gamers to have fun with it as well.


#### Balatro

I didn't play anywhere nearly as much Balatro this year as I did last year, but I _did_ manage to get to 100% completion this year (that's the elusive Completionist++ achievement), and yes, I'm more proud of that than I should be.


#### Video games I replayed in 2025

- _Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition_ - It's highly possible my actual most-played game of 2025 was originally released in 2017.

  After buying a Switch 2, I spent dozens and dozens of hours just enjoying how gorgeous Hyrule could be in 4k/60fps. In fact, I eventually did my first-ever 120-shrine run of the game, and I enjoyed virtually every minute of it, even more than my first time through.

- _Metroid Dread_ - Like _Super Metroid_, _Dread_ is becoming an annual tradition for me.

- _Super Metroid_ and _A Link to the Past_ - not only did I replay both of these all-time classics in their original form this year, but I played the randomizer version of each one, _and_ did some runs on the combined randomizer (where you "warp" between the games, finding items for both, and try to eventually beat both). …Unless you're from Nintendo legal, in which case: I made all this up as a joke.

- _Metroid Prime Remastered_ - I didn't know Prime 4 was coming out this year when I replayed Prime, but it worked out well. (Man, I played a lot of Metroid games this year. I didn't start _Prime 4_ yet, though, because when I do play it, I want to be able to give it my full focus, and not try to cram it into random 10–20 minute sessions as a baby allows.)

- _Death's Door_ - A great, tough little Zelda-like. I wish it ran better on Switch, but it was still fun to replay this adventure (and even get the good ending this time). I'd probably play it again if it were upgraded for Switch 2.

- _Tunic_ - I probably did at least 3 or 4 runs of Tunic this year, including unlocking all the achievements. It's a masterpiece in the Metroidbrainia genre—though it doesn't run especially well on Switch, and so and I desperately hope a Switch 2 edition might be in the works.

- _Astalon: Tears of the Earth_ - A highly underrated throwback to the 8-bit era that I enjoyed even more my second time through. You swap between three unique characters in this Metroidvania about scaling a tower of monsters, leveling them up and solving puzzles as you go. A hidden gem, in my mind.

- _Super Mario 3D World_ - I've played this game plenty, but after getting my Switch 2 I took the time to 100% it this year, which I'd never done before. (Technically I'm not quite there; I still have to get every flagpole with every character, but eff that. I've done literally everything else.)


### Tabletop games

- _Skull_ - a deceptively minimalistic bidding and bluffing game that works for groups of just about any age. There are very few mechanics to work with here, which keeps the game simple.

  Each player has a hand of four cards: three flower cards, along with one skull card. Everyone chooses two of their cards, and places them face-down in front of them in a pile. Then, players can either add cards, or begin bidding on how many flower cards they think they can turn over—from their pile or anyone else's—before hitting a skull. The twist is: if you win the bidding, you _must_ turn over all your cards first, which means your bid _is_ your bluff (or not). Maybe a player who bids is signaling they didn't set a trap...or maybe they _did_, and they're trying to lure you into it.

  It's almost easier to play than it is to explain, but the cleverly approachable bluffing mechanics make this a fantastic ice breaker of a game with enough depth to keep it interesting for many rounds.

- _Patchwork_ - a clever 2-player game that's simple and easy enough for kids to play, but with enough strategy and intricate mechanics for any age to enjoy. I can just as easily play this with my first-grader, my wife, who isn't much for games, or my brother, who's a strategic mastermind.

- _Ice Cool 2_ - a random game store find by my kid, this is a chaotically fun game about flicking weighted penguin tokens between rooms in a cardboard high school. (High school...Ice Cool...get it?)

  Each player is trying either to capture fish by whisking their penguin through doorways, or trying to catch the other penguins and send them back to class. There are cards that reward trick shots, and the fun of the game is largely in how unpredictably the tokens can move.

- _Love Letter_ - still one of my absolute all-time favorites, with a perfect mix of luck and skill for short, accessible games.

- _Forbidden Island_ - a cooperative game not unlike _Pandemic_ (by the same creator, in fact), but a bit more simplified (and with a less trauma-inducing theme). Players try to collect treasure from a sinking island and escape together in time, using their unique character abilities.

- _Sushi Go_ - it's already in everyone's collection for good reason. It's a blast to draft cards to build the perfect sushi orders—or maybe, thwart the player next to you.

### Daily puzzle games

- [_Clues by Sam_](https://cluesbysam.com) - one of the few games I actually play every day, this tantalizingly tricky game of logic challenges you to deduce who's innocent and who's a criminal, with clues that trickle in as you successfully narrow down who's who. It's easily accessible on Mondays and gets harder throughout the week, so the weekends can feel nearly impossible at first. But figuring out how to combine all the clues to get the piece of info you need never stops being satisfying.

- [_Inkwell games_](https://inkwellgames.com/) - I'm particularly a fan of _Stars_ (AKA Star Battle), a more minimalist version of Sudoku where you place stars on a grid, two in each row, column, and segment. There's also _Fields_, though, where you use logic to color in grid cells, and more games coming. But what I like about Inkwell is the UI; they nail the look and feel better than anyone. Excited to see it continue to improve.

- [_Thinky Dailies_](https://thinkygames.com/dailies/) - A completely different puzzle every day. Some days it might be like sudoku or picross; some days it might be a rebus or something entirely different. (Note: the puzzle you're required to complete to join, as of writing, is much harder than the puzzles available once you actually do get inside.)

- [_Connections_](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) - I like to try to get the purple category first. (I'm pretty good at it.)

- _The NYT crossword_ - Though I've already moved on, for several months of 2025 I did the daily crossword faithfully, and even got pretty good at it. (I really like Sundays, or other days with tricky meta-puzzles to decode about the arrangement of the answers.)


## Books

Reading is _mostly_ an in-bed activity for me, so I don't tend to get through too many books in a year, but I managed a few more than normal this year.

- _Cloud Atlas_ - not only my favorite thing I read in 2025 but also one of my favorite books I've ever read, _Cloud Atlas_ is essentially six stories in one. The gimmick is: you only read the first half of the first story, before that one ends abruptly, and you find yourself dropped without warning into the next—a seemingly unrelated story, not only decades in the future, but written in an entirely different genre.

  This dynamic repeats until you've read the first half of each of the six stories in the book (and spanned a few hundred years' worth of both past and future). Then the sixth story ends, and you go backwards, finishing the fifth, fourth, and so on, until you finally conclude where you started, with a clear view of the thin thread that runs through all six stories and connects them.

  It's not an easy read, as the premise suggests; you'll be nearly halfway through the book before the format really begins to pay off (and by then you'll be waiting for a lot of closure). But for intrepid readers willing to make the journey, I found _Cloud Atlas_ to be unforgettably satisfying.

- _The Ministry of Time_ - a genre mishmash that's part romance novel, part sci-fi, and part historical fiction. The premise: the British discover time travel, but want to gauge its effects, so they save a bunch of people from various points in history who would've otherwise died (but who wouldn't necessarily be missed if they were to disappear just before that moment), and rescue them by bringing them to the current day. Each rescuee is assigned a sort of live-in case worker called a "bridge" to monitor and guide them in the modern world, and the book mainly follows one particular pair, and the relationship that gradually develops between them.

  The premise is fascinating, even if the story was a little predictable at times, and I never got bored of seeing modern society from the vantage point of people with entirely different conceptions of what "normal" is.

- _This is How You Lose the Time War_ - another sci-fi/romance mishmash, this one about competing time-bending secret agents who form a bond over their isolated lives spent trying to change history to create the future.

- _Signal Fires_ - a captivating family drama with tragically relatable characters, about two families that live across the street from one another, and the handful of life-changing events that intertwine them.

  I found the ending mildly unsatisfying, but the journey was mesmerizing enough for me to recommend anyway. This is a book that's stayed with me.

- _Children of Time_ and _Children of Ruin_ - the _Children of Time_ series starts with these two books, which I lovingly refer to as "Michael Crichton in space."

  Humans in the future develop a turbo-evolution "virus" which they plan to unleash on a planet of apes, so that those apes can evolve into humans and have the planet ready when the original humans from Earth show up centuries into the future. But when disaster strikes and the apes don't make it to the planet (but the evolution virus _does_), the humans arrive to find a hyper-evolved species of sophisticated, sentient arachnids instead.

  The narrative bounces between the refugees from Earth hoping to find a habitable planet, and the spiders and their culture, trying to understand the universe they've been awakened to, and the creators who made them.

  Both books are captivating, deeply scientific, thrilling, at times horrifying, but almost oddly optimistic in their finales.

- _Just Keep Buying_ - if you're not into financial advice books, you can skip this one.

- _The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay_ - I won't finish this one before the year ends, but I'm far enough through I feel confident still including it here.

  At a high level, this is a story of two Jewish cousins in New York in the 1930s who set out to create a comic book, which eventually becomes wildly successful. But the story is told in vignettes of their lives, and the author is in no hurry on his path of exploration. The backdrop of the beginning of World War II adds added poignancy to these characters and their desperate motivations to do something to change their worlds.


## Other stuff I liked this year

(Note: none of these links are referral links. I just included them for convenience.)


### Kitchen stuff

- A good carbon steel pan - I have the [OXO 10-inch carbon steel pan](https://www.oxo.com/obsidian-carbon-steel-10-frypan-with-silicone-sleeve.html), which feels like the right size for an all-purpose pan.

  I started using a carbon steel pan as my go-to skillet this year, and I've been a fan. Cooking with carbon steel is similar to using cast iron, but carbon steel is _much_ lighter, and smoother. Keep it properly seasoned, and the carbon steel pan works essentially like a nonstick pan. (Previously, we were using ceramic nonstick, like the OurPlace Always pan, but we didn't like how quickly they wore out for the price.)

- [OXO herb keeper](https://www.oxo.com/greensaver-herb-keeper-large.html) - I refer to this as our cilantro keeper, but whatever kind of herb you like will have its life extended significantly by this handy container that helps keep it both watered and properly aerated (not to mention stored simply and easily anywhere in the fridge).


### Home and personal stuff

- [Aura Frames](https://auraframes.com/) - a great way to share photos with family, and to actually _look_ at all those photos you've taken on your phone camera. With a frame that cycles through photos, you don't need to feel like every shot needs to be perfect (as you might with a typical framed photo), and the sharing aspect makes it easy to send and receive photos from loved ones. Pretty much my whole family has these frames, and they were often a source of joy.

- [Leesa Sapira hybrid mattress](https://www.leesa.com/products/leesa-hybrid-mattress) - my wife and I were due to replace our bed anyway when we slept on this mattress on vacation this summer. We absolutely loved how it felt—firm enough for me, soft enough for her, and with barely any bouncy shockwaves to disturb your partner. It's admittedly spendy, but we're at the age where good sleep is an investment in body and mind, so it's worth the price.

- [Yogasleep Dohm Nova](https://yogasleep.com/products/dohm-nova-sound-machine-and-night-light) - white noise machines are nice in any case, but especially when kids or house guests are involved. This little machine, that produces adjustable noise from an actual fan (so it doesn't sound all digital, or have anys speaker to wear out over time), is delightfully simple and effective.

- [Zelus weighted vest](https://zelusfitness.com/products/weighted-vest-12lb-black-fwv-1200-bk) - I know it's kind of a fad right now, but some days I don't have time for any more exercise than a walk, and it's nice to be able to use this vest to make that walk just a little bit more of a workout.

- Under-desk walking pad - although I don't love the one I have ([the Kingsmith Z1 foldable](https://www.kingsmith.com/products/walkingpad-z1-foldable-walking-pad)), I do love being able to walk during the workday. It's more of a pain to set up and take down than I'd like, and the fold in the middle is more of a hindrance than a help for me. Still, I'm not sure if there are better options, and regardless: the benefit is worth the hassle.


## Miscellaneous

- I didn't do a lot of writing this year, but I'm particularly proud of [this piece on AI from earlier this month](/blog/sloptimism).

- Costco rotisserie chicken - Costco is my favorite store anyway, but this deliciously roasted chicken is one of my favorite repeated purchases of the year. I've used it to make chicken caesar salads; wraps of all kinds; tacos; chicken salad; curry; soups; sandwiches; greek bowls; and all kinds of other stuff. And again, it's only $5, which is less than a package of lunch meat (and so if I don't use it all, I don't feel too bad about it).

- [Aldi Rustic Italian Boule](https://www.aldi.us/product/simply-nature-organic-rustic-italian-boule-0000000000056776) - Ever since we discovered this curiously named bread (it's actually a five-ingredient sourdough, and I'm not at all sure what's supposed to be Italian about it), it's become the only bread we buy. It's nicely soft and thick for sandwiches, but toasts up perfectly for toast or grilled cheese. Trust me: this is the bread you want.

- My favorite life hack from this year (if you'll excuse the term): making grilled cheese in the air fryer. Works great for any hot sandwich, and heats the middle much better than a griddle. Just preheat your air fryer to 350°, and put the sandwich(es) in for about 3–5 minutes per side. _Perfection_.

- I love [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/). I've become more and more concerned about where its leadership might be taking it over time (and it most certainly has earned its reputation as a place for people who don't get jokes and will chide you for ridiculous things sometimes), but for now at least, it's my home on the internet. A lot of my favorite things I read this year were Bluesky posts and threads.

- The [Flesh and Code podcast](https://wondery.com/shows/flesh-and-code/), which is all about people who have relationships with AI companions. It starts slow (and predictably), but it goes to some wildly unexpected places. It's an eye-opening, intimate look into many people's personal lives, and I definitely came away with an entirely new perspective.

Cheers to 2026, friends.
